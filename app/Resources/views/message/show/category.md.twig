{% if categories|length > 0 %}
I have the following list of categories for you:
{% for category in categories %}
- {{ category.title }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
Sorry, you didn't track any expenses yet and I didn't have any categories created.
Please use the following example command to track your spendings and I will get the categories:

``` - food $15.28```
{% endif %}
